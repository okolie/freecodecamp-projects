        </div>

        <div>
          <ul>
            <li><span>1914</span> - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
            <li>
              <span>1933</span> - Leaves his family's farm to attend the
              University of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known
              as the "National Youth Administration"
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1935</span>
              - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian
              Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food
              changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1937</span>
              - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1938</span>
              - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to
              budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to
              school study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding
              pest-resistent plants.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1941</span>
              - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack,
              but is rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on
              waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, disinfectants, and other
              applied science.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1942</span>
              - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1944</span>
              - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his
              pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology
              program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000 different
              strains of disease resistent wheat - including different varieties
              for each major climate on Earth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1945</span>
              - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, doubling wheat
              yields
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1953</span>
              - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with a
              high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds well
              to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1962</span>
              - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains of wheat to
              the Indian subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation
              due to a rapidly expanding population
            </li>
            <li>
              <span>1970</span>
              - receives the Nobel Peace Prize
            </li>
